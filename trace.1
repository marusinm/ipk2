.SH NAME
traceroute - network utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trace
[\fB\-f\fR \fIfirst_ttl\fR]
[\fB\-m\fR \fImax_ttl\fR]
.IR ip-address

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B traceroute
is a utility that records the route (the specific gateway computers at each hop) through the Internet between your computer and a specified destination computer. It also calculates and displays the amount of time each hop took. Traceroute is a handy tool both for understanding where problems are in the Internet network and for getting a detailed sense of the Internet itself. Another utility, PING, is often used prior to using traceroute to see whether a host is present on the network.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-m
Set first TTL hop and max TTL hop
by default: first ttl = 1, max ttl = 30

DNS translation is implemented!

.SH IMPLEMENTATION PART

Firstly there are standard options handling in begginng of 
.B traceroute.cpp
and filling 
.B struct params
with this data via 
.B getParams
function.
.br
.B main
funcion is core of traceroute.cpp and perform all functionality. Firstly we fill 
.B addrinfo hints
where we sets
.B SOCK_DGRAM
and other usefull flags. Then new socket is created and the cyckle from first ttl to max ttl starts iterate. Program checks if we perform for IPv4 or IPv6 on many places, we use different structs and tags for these two protocols. 
.br 
Socket is send via sendto() function and receives data in recvmsg() function.  
.B getnameinfo()
function is used for extracts host name from IP address and
.B getaddrinfo() 
for extracts IP from host name.
